Background

The roots of tobacco use in cultures are embedded in religion and healing, dating as far back as 1 B.C. However, the promotion of its use as a smoke, circa the 18th century, gave way to the “rise” of smoke-tobacco, indirectly leading to a blossoming relationship between man and substance. To this day, studies show that, worldwide, nearly 2-3 times as many men smoke compared to women.

Problem

The development and promotion of tobacco products over the centuries has lead to one of the worlds most lucrative industries. However, even with countless scientific studies to substantiate it’s effects and associated health risks, in conjunction with the anti-tobacco groups advocating against its use, the main health risks associated with smoke-tobacco (i.e. lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke) continue to produce an alarming number of deaths in gender-specific populations per year, particularly males.

Objective

Explore the effects of smoking on mortality rates of male populations through rate comparison across different age and smoking groups.
